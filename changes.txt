* TODO

** compilers
- restore asmcomp/ for x86 at least (and x86_64 later and Arm)
  
** dev infra
- restore working semgrep.yml

** test infra
- restore testasmcomp

* 0.1 (Q2 2025) (Dockerfile, Nix, Github Actions CI checks, dune, tests)
#TODO: ported enough features so can compile some of xix via bootstrap-mk.sh

** stdlib
- frontport Obj.is_int and Obj.xxx_tag from 2.02
- frontport Printf.kprintf and ksprintf and support for %! to flush from 3.08
- frontport uchar.ml from 4.03
- frontport bool.ml, int.ml, and float.ml from 4.08
- frontport option.ml and result from 4.08 as well as the result pervasive type

** language
- partial support for attributes ([@@...]) and object types (<Cap.exec; ..>)
  just enough so can parse the code in xix (but discard the constructs)

** typechecker
- frontport ability to type string-format in higher order functions like
  Logs.info (fun m -> m "%s" name) (extension to type_expect())
  
** test infra
- add Dockerfile and docker.yml GHA (Github Action) CI checks
- add shell.nix and nix.yml GHA for macOS and Linux CI checks
- add back the test/ and testasmcomp/ (but not testobjects/) from
  the OCaml github repo at the 1.07 time (commit a234a77991)
  and run them in the Dockerfile and in CI
  => minimum regression test infra!

** dev infra
- compile ocaml light code also with dune! so get better warnings,
  faster build, and the production of .cmt in _build/ allowing
  merlin (and efuns) to work correctly for file navigation and type info!
- started to use poor's man Logs (needed typechecker improvement too)

** internals
- remove files and support for old arch (alpha, mips, sparc, vax, etc.)
  and OSes (macOS, windows NT, Solaris)

** misc
- fix configure to work with recent gcc/clang (add some
  -Wno-implicit-function-declaration and other flags)
- frontport ability to store source in Foo.ml or foo.ml  
  
* Beta (2018) (plan9 support)

** os
- compile byterun/ for plan9 so I can run ocaml (light) bytecode programs
  under my fork of plan9

* Alpha (2015) (fork of OCaml 1.07 without OO and functors + native ARM)
# see also pad.txt history section

** language
- remove support for classes and objects (OO) as it complicated a lot the
  typechecking code for a controversial features (typeclasses or
  implicits are IMHO better). See also REMOVE_OBJ.patch.
  Note that I didn't need to remove the use of objects in the compiler itself
  because they didn't even like the oo extensions and so didn't use it :)
- remove functors, again to simplify the code as ocaml light is meant
  for educational purpose (part of my principia softwarica project).
  This meant slightly refactor the asmcomp/ code that was the only user
  of functors (and maybe set and map)
- backport (frontport?) a few features from recent OCaml to ocaml-light:
    * record 'with' (see diff_with_record)
    * backtrace?

** compilers  
- removed some native targets: alpha, hppa, m68k, power, and sparc,
  mips. I just kept i386 and later backported the ARM port from ocaml 2.01!

** stdlib
# see also pad.txt changes section
- frontport buffer.ml ? (from ?)

** build infra
- a working configure that can work on recent Mac or Linux

** os
- remove support for old macOS and Windows NT, to remove ugly cruft.
