* TODO

** test infra

** devops
- shell.nix and nix.yml macOS and Linux GHA CI checks

* 0.1 (Q2 2025) (Dockerfile, Github Actions CI checks (devops), dune, tests)

** test infra
- add back the test/ and testasmcomp/ (but not testobjects/) from
  the OCaml github repo at the 1.07 time (commit a234a77991)

** dev infra
- compile ocaml light also with dune! so get better warnings,
  faster build, and the production of .cmt in _build/ allowing
  merlin to work correctly for file navigation and type info!

** devops
- add Dockerfile and docker.yml GHA (Github Action) CI

* Beta (2017) (plan9 support)

- compile byterun/ for plan9 so I can run ocaml (light) bytecode programs
  under my fork of plan9

* Alpha (2015) (fork of OCaml 1.07 but remove OO and functors)
# see also pad.txt history section

- remove support for classes and objects (OO) as it complicated a lot the
  typechecking code for a controversial features; typeclasses or
  implicits are IMHO better. See also REMOVE_OBJ.patch
- remove functors, again to simplify the code as ocaml light is meant
  for educational purpose (part of my principia softwarica project)
