* TODO

** dev infra
- semgrep.yml
- merlin working on the whole codebase

** test infra

** devops
- shell.nix and nix.yml macOS and Linux GHA CI checks

* 0.1 (Q2 2025) (Dockerfile, Github Actions CI checks (devops), dune, tests)

** test infra
- add back the test/ and testasmcomp/ (but not testobjects/) from
  the OCaml github repo at the 1.07 time (commit a234a77991)

** dev infra
- compile ocaml light also with dune! so get better warnings,
  faster build, and the production of .cmt in _build/ allowing
  merlin to work correctly for file navigation and type info!

** devops
- add Dockerfile and docker.yml GHA (Github Action) CI

* Beta (2018) (plan9 support)

- compile byterun/ for plan9 so I can run ocaml (light) bytecode programs
  under my fork of plan9

* Alpha (2015) (fork of OCaml 1.07 without OO and functors, native ARM)
# see also pad.txt history section

** compiler
- remove support for classes and objects (OO) as it complicated a lot the
  typechecking code for a controversial features; typeclasses or
  implicits are IMHO better. See also REMOVE_OBJ.patch.
  Note that I didn't need to remove the use of objects in the compiler itself
  because they didn't even like the oo extensions and so didn't use it :) 
- remove functors, again to simplify the code as ocaml light is meant
  for educational purpose (part of my principia softwarica project).
  This meant slightly refactor the asmcomp/ code that was the only user
  of functors (and maybe set and map)
- removed some native targets: alpha, hppa, m68k, power, and sparc,
   mips (just kept i386) and I backported the ARM port from ocaml 2.01!
- backport a few features from recent OCaml to ocaml-light:
    * backtrace?
    * record with (see diff_with_record)

** stdlib
- backported a few modules or functions from recent OCaml
  (see pad.txt changes section)

** devops
- a working configure that can work on recent Mac or Linux
- remove support for old macOS and Windows NT, to remove ugly cruft.
