<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="JoeCaml.gif" ALT=""> Caml program examples</H1>

<P>This directory contains some examples of Objective Caml programs.

<P>The examples can either be compiled and executed as standalone
programs (just type <CODE>make</CODE> in the subdirectory), if speed
is important you can use the optimizing compiler by typing
<CODE>make opt</CODE>, or else run interactively the examples under
<CODE>ocaml</CODE>, by executing 

<PRE>
                #use "loadall.ml";;
</PRE>

in the appropriate directory. (The graphics programs must
be run under a specialized interactive system, <CODE>ocamlgraph</CODE>
that you can create using <CODE>ocamlmktop -custom -o ocamlgraph
graphics.cma</CODE>.)

<P>Examples marked (*) are taken from the book ``Le langage Caml'', by
Pierre Weis and Xavier Leroy (InterEditions, 1993 && 1999). Messages and
identifiers may be in French and may contain accented letters (ISO 8859-1
encoding). You'll need an 8-bit clean system to read them.<BR>

Examples marked (G) assume installed the portable graphics library
(as found in the <CODE>otherlib/graph</CODE> directory of the
Objective Caml distribution).

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>One file programs</H2>

<UL>

<LI>basics:<BR>
        A set of simple, basic, and slightly advanced programs.
        See the <A HREF="basics/eng.html">eng.html</A> file.
        Contains also the three all-time favorites: Fibonacci,
        Eratosthene's sieve, and the Unix <CODE>wc</CODE> utility.

<LI>colwheel: (G)<BR>
        The "color wheel" (color space in HSV coordinates).
        Needs at least 256 colors to look good.

<LI>spirals: (G)<BR>
        Explore a family of flashy curves. (Use spir on a color screen
        and spir-bw on a black and white screen.)

<LI>showsort: (G)<BR>
        Graphic animation of sorting algorithms.

<LI>hanoi: (*)(G)<BR>
        Animated towers of Hanoi. Uses lists and strings.

<LI>doctor: (*)<BR>
        A (English-speaking) clone of Eliza.

<LI>docteur: (*)<BR>
        A (French-speaking) clone of Eliza.
        If you can translate this
        program in any other language than english, please contact
        Pierre.Weis@inria.fr.

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Graphical User Interface</H2>

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="camltk/eng.html">camltk</A>: (*) <BR>
       A set of programs to learn using the Caml/Tk graphical user
       interface (GUI). From simple «hello world» programs to an
       advanced tetris game. Some examples are from the book ``Le
       langage Caml'', by Pierre Weis and Xavier Leroy
       (InterEditions, 1999). See the <A
       HREF="camltk/eng.html">eng.html</A> file in the directory. 
</UL>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Modular programs</H2>

<P>Those programs are in the corresponding directories. They are
complete independant applications that have a Makefile to handle
their recompilation. Those examples can be quite involved.

<UL>

<LI>calc:<BR>
        This is a simple desk calculator that illustrates the use of camllex 
        and camlyacc.

<LI>picomach: (*)<BR>
        An assembler and simulator for a RISC processor.

<LI>grep: (*)<BR>
        Regular expressions and automata.

<LI>compress: (*)<BR>
        File compression and decompression (Huffman).

<LI>demonstr: (*)<BR>
        Tautology checker.

<LI>minicaml: (*)<BR>
        An interpreter and typechecker for a subset of Caml.

<LI>asl:<BR>
        This is the implementation of A Small Language, as described in
        part 3 of ``Functional Programming using Caml Light'', by
        Michel Mauny.

<LI>minilogo: (*) (G)<BR>
        An interpreter for a small language with turtle graphics.

<LI>pascal: (*)<BR>
        An interpreter and compiler for a subset of Pascal.
        The compiler generates code for the <CODE>picomach</CODE> program.

<LI>kb:<BR>
        The Knuth-Bendix completion procedure for rewriting systems.
        Taken from some course notes by Gerard Huet.

</UL>

<P>
The <CODE>config</CODE> directory does not contain examples, but configuration
files used to generate the Makefiles.
