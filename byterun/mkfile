# If you want to cross compile ocamlrun, you need to add this 
# to byterun/config.h after the #include ../config/s.h:
#   #include "plan9.h"
# If you want to cross compile ocamlc, that is to produce an ocamlc
# that will work under plan9, you also need to modify utils/config.ml and put:
#   let bytecomp_c_compiler = "pcc "
#   let c_libraries = ""
#   let ext_obj = ".8"
# Then run mk and mk install
#
# For the other libraries you currently need to go in each
# otherlibs/str otherlibs/unix and otherlibs/threads and run
# mk; mk install from there.
# You also need to comment the call using sigvtalarm in otherlibs/threads/.

#related:
#http://mirtchovski.com/p9/ocaml/ is a port of ocaml 3.10 to plan9
# but it uses APE so it not a big win. At least he ported the Makefile to mk.

#old: I was adding -p in CFLAGS to use the ANSI preprocessor, because the
# builtin cpp in 8c does not support complex conditions in #ifdef such as
# #if defined(X) && !defined(Y).
# But it was not enough. The ANSI preprocessor /bin/cpp operates in a
# traditional mode where macro calls with space before as in alloc (1,2)
# are not handled, and byterun/ is full of that. Moreover byterun
# uses a lot of unixisms, signals, select, etc which are not supported
# by default by plan9. So I switched to pcc and ape (I had to patch
# pcc in kencc though to call gcc -E instead of /bin/cpp).
#Note also that the pcc from kencc needs a /bin/8c (or /bin/5c if you
# set objtype to arm)

# If you want to use APE, uncomment the following
CC=pcc
LD=pcc -f
# I removed -T because prims.c (a generated file) has wrong signatures 
# (but it's ok).
# I added here some -D_xxx instead of config.h because some files 
# don't include config.h, so simpler to do it here once and for all.
CFLAGS=-FV -c -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_BSD_EXTENSION -DOS_PLAN9_APE
# add this if you want better trace -DDEBUG

# If you do not want to use APE, uncomment the following
#LD=5l -f
#CFLAGS=-FV -I/home/pad/plan9/sys/include/arm -I/home/pad/plan9/sys/include
